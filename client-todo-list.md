# To-Do list for Butterium development 📒

- [ ] Add a one-time "if you like this pack please favourite it on MR and join the DC" pop-up

- [ ] ButterHost integration and features
> ↳  Like starting a free trial from in game *(referral system too)*

- [ ] Launcher Crash Assistant
> ↳  With Discord link and "copy logs" button

- [ ] Fix Modrinth "listings"

- [ ] Redesign HUD editor w/ support for resizable HUD widgets
> ↳  With sliders and context/options menus

- [ ] Translucent HUD widget backgrounds

- [ ] Set up Discord Status to include download button

- [ ] e4mc fork with custom username.butr.fun IP for world sharing

- [ ] Partnered servers? Default to partner.butr.fun on quick connect first launch
> ↳  For cool partnered events servers, show their live events on the main menu like Bedrock

- [ ] Installer, launcher and minimal mobile app
> ↳  https://github.com/BUTR-Studios/BUTR-Launcher

- [ ] Move assets to resources
> ↳  Also allow resource pack to edit configs and stuff with txts like overrides (prompt first)

>    Rework all icons as pixel-perfect images (maybe with seperate folder for included shadows)

>    Move all text to localization keys

- [ ] Spec detection and optimization 
> ↳  https://github.com/BUTR-Studios/spec-engine

- [ ] Simple and temporary Python Butterium launcher and installer
> ↳  It's being developed by **me**, Claude and Gemini lmfao

- [ ] Screenshot previews and viewer

- [ ] Hook in with Blossom Events
> ↳  PvP practise gamemode too or something

- [x] Armor and tool durability notifications

- [ ] Ports to 1.21.1 and 1.20.1 Fabric

- [ ] Allow compatible mods to be installed from in-game
> ↳  "You have unsaved changes" text for when the user needs to restart their game

>    Remove mods with .bat/.sh

>    Inspired by Lunar and Feather mods screens- showing just icons, clicking them opens the description and/or config (maybe a description screen with a button for config)

- [ ] Update and enable friends sidebar
> ↳  With world/server invites, friends sidebar is half-finished

- [ ] Specs and help screen
> ↳  Similar to the old Astro/ButterSmooth one

- [ ] Click FX at the cursor

- [ ] Donate and Discord buttons in options

- [ ] Fix variable names and values + simplify and optimize all layouts and element anchors
> ↳  This will help users better understand Butterium and edit the FM configuration

- [ ] Known mod incompatibility warning from GitHub (ver).txt
> ↳  Compare loaded mods to a GitHub list of incompatible mods - also send to logs

- [ ] Custom inventory shortcuts
> ↳  Should be styled like the inventory and also adapt to resource packs, maybe contact some RP creators to add support

- [x] Remove some layouts for settings menus
> ↳  Would improve mod compatability with mods that change settings

- [ ] Send specs to API on command using MC username
> ↳  Optionally also logs but we must ask for the users explicit permission and warn them of what logs store before doing anything

- [ ] Advanced customisation button in personalisation and Credits menus that leads to new menu
> ↳  This menu should teach users how to create and download resource packs for Butterium

- [x] Custom background replacing "0" in the BG carousel

- [ ] Light and Midnight UI themes
> ↳  credit: fishandchips

- [ ] Animated background (GIF, MP4 and MOV support)
> ↳  Likely to be used for user-added custom backgrounds

- [x] Use the accent colour in more places and improve UI design
> ↳  Follow where OreUI would normally put its default green accent colour

- [ ] Tools for resource pack creators
> ↳  W/ FMv3.8.0 - imagine making a resource pack just by walking around your world and clicking blocks to change their texture by selecting a png from your system. This will update the pack you're working on in real time but won't **replace** messing with files

- [ ] Toggleable health indicators
> ↳  Could be done with a resource pack or mod
