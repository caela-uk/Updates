# To-Do list for Butterium development 📒

- [ ] HEX code accent colours
> https://github.com/Keksuccino/FancyMenu/issues/1398

- [ ] Allow compatible mods to be installed from in-game
> "You have unsaved changes" text for when the user needs to restart their game

> Inspired by Lunar and Feather mods screens- showing just icons, clicking them opens the description and/or config (maybe a description screen with a button for config)

- [ ] Test auto-update and updating mods
> https://discord.com/channels/704163135787106365/1429870103545118840

> With "downloading update" and "your game may freeze during install, don't worry" texts

- [ ] Update and enable friends sidebar
> The friends sidebar is half-finished but the API is there and enabled/working

- [ ] Switch to .webp for backgrounds and more
> Not possible YET, request in FancyMenu GitHub

- [ ] Specs and help screen
> Similar to the old Astro/ButterSmooth one

- [ ] Credits screen with Butterium settings

- [ ] Open screen effects GIF (maybe at the mouse cursor)

- [ ] Space background with intense reverse parallax effect

- [ ] Donate and Discord buttons in options

- [ ] Fix variable names and values
> This will help users better understand Butterium and edit the FM configuration

- [ ] Known mod incompatibility warning from GitHub (ver).txt
> Compare loaded mods to a GitHub list of incompatible mods

- [ ] Known mod incompatibilities should be logged
> In the Minecraft logs using FMs new action

- [ ] Custom inventory shortcuts
> Should be styled like the inventory and also adapt to resource packs, maybe contact some RP creators to add support

- [ ] Port to 1.21.1 and NeoForge

- [ ] Remove some layouts for settings menus
> Would improve mod compatability with mods that change settings

- [ ] Send specs to API on command using MC username
> Optionally also logs but we must ask for the users explicit permission and warn them of what logs store before doing anything

- [ ] Advanced customisation button in personalisation and Credits menus that leads to new menu
> This menu should allow for the changing of asset locations and teach users how to create resource packs too

- [ ] Custom background replacing "0" in the BG carousel

- [ ] Move Butterium assets to a resource pack
> Would allow for resource packs to change Butterium assets

- [ ] Replace button labels and text with localisation keys
> Would allow for multiple languages to be supported and for labels to change with resource packs

- [ ] Animated background (GIF, MP4 and MOV support)
> Likely to be used for user-added custom backgrounds

- [ ] Use the accent colour in more places and improve UI design
> Follow where OreUI would normally put its default green accent colour

- [ ] Tools for resource pack creators
> With new FancyMenu v3.8.0 actions - imagine making a resource pack just by walking around your world and clicking blocks to change their texture by selecting a png from your system. This will update the pack you're working on in real time but won't **replace** messing with files
